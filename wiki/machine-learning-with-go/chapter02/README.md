Matrices, Probability, and Statistics
[Page 71-105, 34]

Although we will take a mostly practical/applied approach to machine learningthroughout this book, certain fundamental topics are essential to understand andproperly apply machine learning. In particular, a fundamental understanding ofprobability and statistics will allow us to match certain algorithms with relevantproblems, understand our data and results, and apply necessary transformations toour data. Matrices and a little linear algebra will then allow us to properly representour data and implement optimizations, minimizations, and matrix-basedtransformations.

Do not worry too much if you are a little rusty in math or statistics. We will cover afew of the basics here and show you how to programmatically work with the relevantstatistical measures and matrix techniques that will be utilized later in the book. Thatbeing said, this is not a book on statistics, probability, and linear algebra. To truly beproficient in machine learning, one should take time to learn these subjects on adeeper level.
